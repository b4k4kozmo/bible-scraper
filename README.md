# bible-scraper
 scrape specific chapters of the bible and output to txt as a list

 replace "book" and "chapter" variables with the book name and chapter number *AS A STRING*
 Note: Books such as "John 2" will require the "2" to be placed infront of the chapter number

 for instance
 book = "john"
 chapter = "201"

 this will output the entire first chapter of John 2 as a txt file named John201.txt

 after changing the variables you just need to run bible_scraper.py

 and that's it.

 definitely more you can do with it if you tweak the link, but i will add more features in the future so you can display output as either joined string or an array, and change the translation. All can be done manually but i plan to make it more dynamic
